# Fumo.One

This repo contains the source files for the (soon to be) website [Fumo.One](https://www.fumo.one)

## Purpose

The purpose of this project, is to make a modernized version of another [Fumo Website](https://fumo.website/) with additional features like filters and personal checklists.

## Architecture

Currently, the website runs on a combination of [NextJS](https://nextjs.org/) and [Contentful](https://www.contentful.com/), which gets deployed onto [Vercel](https://vercel.com) (Including [ISR](https://nextjs.org/docs/basic-features/data-fetching/incremental-static-regeneration), so that I don't have to rebuild the entire website for adding a Fumo).
